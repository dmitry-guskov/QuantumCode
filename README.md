# QuantumCode
Project to simplify work with channel tomography on IBM via Qiskit

Main work result summarized in ChannelTomography file. It provides framework for easy quantum channel estimation of circuit 
and further with that you can reconstruct an output qubit by input qubit. 
Basically, it was made for teleportation purpose so you can choose input qubit which should be teleported and output where you listen final state.
